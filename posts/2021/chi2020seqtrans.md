# SeqTrans: Automatic Vulnerability Fix via Sequence to Sequence Learning

Link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10805

## Problem to Solve

**Software vulnerability** can be viewed as a specific category of bugs that are still mainly solved by programmers' manual efforts. An **automated** method based on **Neural Machine Translation** (NMT), which is previously used for bugs repairs, can also be transfered to target on the **vulnerability fixes** after fine-tuning.

## Methodology

### Overview
