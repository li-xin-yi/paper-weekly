# MiniBox: A Two-Way Sandbox for x86 Native Code (ACT'14)

Link: https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc14/technical-sessions/presentation/li_yanlin

## Problem to solve


Provides a two-way sandbox for x86 native code:

- **OS protection**: prevent a benign OS from a misbehaving app (e.g., sandbox)
- **App protection**: prevent an application from a malicious OS (e.g., SGX, enclave)

Risks in previously existing work:

**Iago attack**: a malicious OS can subvert a protected process by returning a carefully chosen sequence of return values to **sensitive system calls**. 
  - For example, a malicious OS returns a memory address that is in the applicationâ€™s stack memory for an `mmap` system call
  - sensitive data (e.g., a return address) in the stack may subsequently be overwritten by the mapped data.


## Methodology

![](/images/minibox/arch.jpg)

- Service runtime module: support native app in MIEE
  - **Context switch**: stores and switches thread contexts between app and service
  - **System call dispatcher**: distinguishes between *sensitive* and *non-sensitive* system call, if non-sensitive, triggers an environment switch and forwards the call to the OS (via hypervisor), otherwise, forward to LibOS.
  - **Param marshaling**: encode the parameters *(??? I think it should refer to the arguments in non-sensitive system calls)*
- OS protection modules
  - **Program loader**: sets up MIEE and load app into it.
  - **Context switch**: stores and restores the thread context between the regular environment and MIEE
  - **parameter unmarshaling**: decodes parameters
  - **System call dispatcher**: sanitizes the system call parameters, conducts access control to constrain the file access of the application, and forwards the non-sensitive system calls to corresponding handlers in the regular environment.


### Remote Verifier

It directly adopts the mechanism in their previous work, [TrustVisor](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5504713), to enable a remote verifier to verify the integrity of the hypervisor, the service runtime, and the isolated application.

- Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement mechanism runs on commodity x86 processors
- The chipset computes an integrity measurement (cryptographic **hash**) of the hypervisor, and extends the resulting hash into a Platform Configuration Register (PCR) in the Trusted Platform Module (TPM).
- TrustVisor computes an integrity measurement for each registered PAL (Piece of Application Logic), and extends that measurement result into the PAL'$\mu$TPM instance. ($\mu$TPM: small TPM abstract for each PAL)
- The TPM Quote from the hardware TPM
- The $\mu$TPM Quote from the PAL's $\mu$TPM instance


### Multi-threading

If applying a 1:1 thread model like NaCl and using the OS to handle thread-related
system calls, the OS controls the thread context of the application threads, which could break CFI of the application by changing the **thread context**. So it keeps all thread context in MIEE by duplicating all supported thread synchronization system
call handlers.
